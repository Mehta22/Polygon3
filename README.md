# Polygon3

## Overview

Briefly describe the purpose and components of your project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any software or accounts needed to run your project.

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions to install necessary dependencies.

## Project Structure

Explain the organization of your project files.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Circuit Implementation

#### File: circuit.circom

```circom
// Your circom circuit code here
```

### 2. Compile the Circuit

After writing the circuit, compile it to generate circuit intermediaries.

```bash
circom circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
```

### 3. Generate Proof

Use the compiled circuit and specified inputs (A=0, B=1) to generate a proof.

```bash
snarkjs groth16 prove circuit.wasm circuit_final.zkey input.json proof.json
```

### 4. Deploy Solidity Verifier

Deploy a Solidity verifier contract to the Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet.

### 5. Verification

Call the `verifyProof()` method on the deployed verifier contract and assert that the output is `true`.

## Additional Notes

Include any additional information or considerations.

## License

Specify the license under which your project is distributed.
